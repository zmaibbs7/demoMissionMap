# Demo Mission Map

This repository demonstrates a simple mission map module for tracking a robot's
coverage on a grid map.

See `project/mission_map_module` for the implementation. A small demo is
provided via `project/demo.py` which creates a sample map, simulates a short
robot trajectory, and writes the resulting coverage maps and JSON report to the
`demo_output/` directory.

Run the demo with:

```bash
python3 project/demo.py
```
